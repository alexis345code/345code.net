## Overview

Cavavin Rustington needed to keep track of stock and find product from their database directly on their ICRTouch till. 

Because wine names are long, and people need to search by grape variety, tasting notes, or simple title, we wrote - from scratch - a full integration with their own wine database.

The search interface sits on top of the cash register screen and when the product required is located, info can be displayed regarding stock, back-order availability, and fuller descriptions.

When the customer is ready to buy, a + (plus) icon indicates it can be added to the till's cart and finalsed in the normal way.
